Description: Simulation, estimation and testing for geopolitical volatility (GEOVOL) based on the global common volatility model of Engle and Campos-Martins (2023) <doi:10.1016/j.jfineco.2022.09.009>. GEOVOL is modelled as a latent multiplicative volatility factor with heterogeneous factor loadings. Estimation is carried out as a maximization-maximization procedure, where GEOVOL and the GEOVOL loadings are estimated iteratively until convergence.
